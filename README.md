Bus Ticket Reservation System 

Java and SQL involves developing a simple application that handles user registration, ticket booking, seat management, and viewing bus schedules. Below, I will outline the main components of the system and provide a basic structure for your project.

Components:

Database (SQL) Setup:

Bus Schedule: Store information about buses (e.g., bus ID, origin, destination, time, seats available).
Users: Store user information (e.g., user ID, name, email, password).
Bookings: Store booking information (e.g., booking ID, user ID, bus ID, number of tickets booked, seat numbers).

Java Classes:

Database connection class (to interact with SQL database).
User management class (for user registration, login, etc.).
Bus management class (for managing bus schedules and seat availability).
Booking management class (for handling ticket booking, updating seat availability).
Main class (for user interaction).
